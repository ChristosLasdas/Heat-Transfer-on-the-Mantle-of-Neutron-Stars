# Heat-Transfer-on-the-Mantle-of-Neutron-Stars

This repository contains codes that were used in the context of the "Computational Astrophysics" course during the Master's degree in Advanced Studies in Physics offered in the University of Patras. In this course we mainly used Finite Difference Method to discretize the equations.

We have codes that are used for:

* *Heat Transfer on the Mantle of Neutron Stars Without Magnetic Field*
* *Heat Transfer on the Mantle of Neutron Stars With Magnetic Field*
